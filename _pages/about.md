I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Chicago, where I am advised by Professor [Grant Ho](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~grantho/). My research focuses on the application of AI to security problems as well as the privacy and security of ML systems. Apart from this, I am also interested in tech policy and the evolving privacy and security implications of generative AI.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Pomona College. During undergrad, I worked with Professor [Anthony Clark](https://cs.pomona.edu/~ajc//) in the [ARCS Lab](https://cs.pomona.edu/~ajc/arcslab/) and completed a senior thesis on the defense of federated learning against evasion attacks with Professors [Eleanor Birrell](https://cs.pomona.edu/~ebirrell/) and [Anthony Clark](https://cs.pomona.edu/~ajc//). Through cybersecurity and software engineering internships, I have built out ML-driven security solutions for sim-swap fraud detection and various mobile applications, including a social media platform for surfers called [SurfStop](https://github.com/christymarc/SurfStop).

If you have any interest in applying to grad school for CS, the [Resources](https://christymarc.github.io/resources/) tab contains some potentially helpful resources.

## Code To PhD
[Grace Li](https://www.grace-li.org/) and I lead a student-run inter-university initiative called Code to PhD to help underrepresented individuals apply to CS-related PhD programs. We are currently recruiting volunteers for various events and programs. If you are a PhD student interested in helping underrepresented students apply to PhD programs, please fill out this [google form](https://forms.gle/goJcsSCibqgF7Bhp7)!
